### Built with

- CSS custom properties and dynamically rendered css classes
- Flexbox and grid

## My process

- Started writing out plans for the project
- Learnt how o work with the api
- imported my hooks and made adjustments
- Learnt how to cope with strictmode
### What I learnt

1. React:

How to use setInterval and clearInterval - cleanup
Dynamically render prev,active and next classes
Accounted for current index being 0 in calculating previous - checking if its index === data.length-1 (end-of-array error)

2. Css

Slides are initially stacked due to the absolute class of article
Dynamic styles with transform properties are used to place them left or right - activeSlide,lastSlide,nextSlide(default)
Opacity and overflow to hide.

Overall it was a very wonderful project.
